In earlier versions of the meta-atlas (see notebook scVI_meta-atlas_4_V4) we had different names of cell states. These were changed to these latest names.
LSC -> LSC-1
LESC -> LSC-1
CSSC -> qSk
MF -> MC
CDH19+ -> nm-cSC

We used this notebook because from a technical side the names do not matter as they change nothing downstream.
