# Cell-States-and-Key-Transcription-Factors-of-the-Human-Cornea-through-Integrated-Single-Cell-Omics
R scripts and Python notebooks for cPredictor and AnanseScanpy for the human cornea cell state meta-atlas

# Important note:

In earlier versions of the meta-atlas (e.g. see notebook scVI_meta-atlas_4_V4) we had different names of cell states. These were changed to these latest names.
LSC -> LSC-1; LESC -> LSC-1; CSSC -> qSk; MF -> MC; CDH19+ -> nm-cSC

We used this notebook for completeness, because from a technical side the names do not matter as they change nothing downstream.
